# Touch up figure and table captions after using `convert_docx_to_rmd()`

After using
[`convert_docx_to_rmd()`](https://inbo.github.io/protocolhelper/reference/convert_docx_to_rmd.md),
figure and table captions are part of the main text and cross references
to them are just text and numbers, making it difficult to integrate
these `.Rmd` files in reports: they are not automatically renumbered,
these captions cannot be listed,... This function replaces the figure
and table descriptions with true captions, and cross references to these
figures and tables with dynamic references (that refer to the figure or
table label).

## Usage

``` r
add_captions(
  from,
  to,
  name_figure_from = "Figuur",
  name_table_from = "Tabel",
  name_figure_to = "Figuur",
  name_table_to = "Tabel"
)
```

## Arguments

- from:

  The `.Rmd` file to convert. Can be given as an absolute or relative
  path.

- to:

  The filename to write the resulting `.Rmd` file. Can be given as an
  absolute or relative path.

- name_figure_from:

  name that is given to figures in captions and cross references in the
  `.Rmd` provided in `from` (default is `Figuur`)

- name_table_from:

  name that is given to tables in captions and cross references in the
  `.Rmd` provided in `from` (default is `Tabel`)

- name_figure_to:

  name that should be given to figures in cross references in the output
  `.Rmd` (default is `Figuur`)

- name_table_to:

  name that should be given to tables in cross references in the output
  `.Rmd` (default is `Tabel`)

## Details

This function expects an input that is generated by
[`convert_docx_to_rmd()`](https://inbo.github.io/protocolhelper/reference/convert_docx_to_rmd.md),
with

- figure captions below the figure and starting with `Figuur ` (or other
  name to be defined in variable `name_figure`), then a unique number
  and finally the description in one paragraph

- table captions above the table and starting with `Tabel ` (or other
  name to be defined in variable `name_table`), then a unique number and
  finally the description in one paragraph

- figures consisting of one image, not 2 figures near each other

- cross references having the same label as the figure or table they
  refer to, default `Figuur ` or `Tabel ` followed by the unique number
  written in exactly the same way

Please check carefully for mistakes after using this function
