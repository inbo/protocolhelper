# Reagents and Solutions

**Demineralised water**: electrical conductivity less than 2 $\mu S / cm$ at 25 °C.

**Ultra pure water**: electrical conductivity less than 0.1 $\mu S / cm$, equivalent to a resistance greater than 0.01 $M\Omega \quad m$ at 25 °C.
It is recommended to use water from a water purification system that provides ultra pure water with a resistance greater than 0.18 $M\Omega \quad m$ (usually expressed as 18.2 $M\Omega \quad cm$).
