-->

## Material

<!--
(Equipment, Labels, Data registration (GPS, sampling table, tablet, phone, ...))
-->

## Human resources

<!--
Which roles and why? Minimal number of people needed for this procedure? Skill set/training needed for this procedure?
-->

## Dependencies on other procedures

<!--
Should another procedure be known/studied prior to executing this procedure?
The table below is automatically filled in based on information in the yaml section of the `index.Rmd` file
