# Preparations

## Safety

```{=html}
<!--
vaccinations, protective clothing, warnings of dangerous chemicals, emergency protocols
-->
```
## Material

```{=html}
<!--
(Equipment, Labels, Data registration (GPS, sampling table, tablet, phone, ...))
-->
```
## Human resources

```{=html}
<!--
Which roles and why? Minimal number of people needed for this procedure? Skill set/training needed for this procedure?
-->
```
## Dependencies on other procedures

```{=html}
<!--
Should another procedure be known/studied prior to executing this procedure?
The table below is automatically filled in based on information in the yaml section of the `index.Rmd` file
-->
```
```{r dependencies}
