# Overarching workflow with reference to subprotocols

```{=html}
<!--
Provide here an overview of the steps of the project protocol.
The different steps must be clarified with criteria and guidelines when what should be carried out.
For instance:

Go to the location to be monitored.
Follow sub-protocol A `<protocol code>_YYYY.NN` to determine whether the site belongs to the target population to be monitored (first visit) or still belongs (repeated visit).
Follow sub protocol B `<protocol code>_YYYY.NN` which explains the sampling procedure.
Follow sub protocol C `<protocol code>_YYYY.NN` explaining lab analysis.

The objective is to organize the sub-protocols into a coherent main protocol in which missing elements are completed that are not in the sub-protocols, such as when a certain sub-protocol is executed or not, or small extra steps that do not require their own sub-protocol.
