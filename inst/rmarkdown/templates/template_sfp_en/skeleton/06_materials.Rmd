## Reagents and solutions (if applicable)

```{=html}
<!--
A listing of reagents, what purity, volume, safety precautions.
e.g. Sulfuric acid (`H2SO4`), concentrated (96%), pro analysis + safety info (strong acid, corrosive, use gloves, glasses and mask when using)
A list of solutions, which purity, volume, safety regulations.
If these solutions are prepared yourself, also state the method of preparation.
For instance: Sulfuric acid `1M`: dilute sulfuric acid concentrated 18 times with `ultrapure` water.
Attention: always add sulfuric acid to water and never vice versa!
