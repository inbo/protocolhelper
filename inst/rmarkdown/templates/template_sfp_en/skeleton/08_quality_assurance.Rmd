# Quality assurance

```{=html}
<!--
Include all actions when performing the protocol to achieve quality results.
In addition, a checklist can also be added to check whether all steps of the field protocol have been completed correctly (e.g. have all fields in the field form been filled in, are all samples labelled, ...).
If certain quality criteria are not met, corrective measures may be referred to.
This section may also list certain intercalibration exercises, for example performed by the users of the protocol prior to each field season.
